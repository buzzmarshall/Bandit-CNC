# Bandit-CNC
Linux based Custom 4-Color 3D Printer control system.

Original Project was based around a Beaglebone Black with a Pico Systems Cramps 2.2 as well as a number of other embedded boards such as a Rasberry 4 and a Rockchip Pro.

Project has since been changed to use a Mesa Board with some custom hardware and a modified version of LinuxCNC to run that system.

The printers build platform's dimensions allow projects of about 31" x 21" by 22" high to be printed using up to 4 colors of filament without having to stop the process to swap out colors by the use of a 4 in and 4 out hotend.
